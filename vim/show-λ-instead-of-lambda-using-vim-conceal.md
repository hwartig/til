Show `λ` instead of `lambda` in vim using conceal.
==================================================

Vim can help you make your code more readable by concealing complicated expressions by showing
single characters for it. So if you have for example a html source were you have lots of `&amp;`
vim can replace them with a single `&`.

This can also be used to show `λ` instead of `lambda` in ruby source code. Sure enough there is
already a vim plugin [vim-ruby-cute](https://github.com/bigloser/vim-ruby-cute) for it.
